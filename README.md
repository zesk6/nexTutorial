#interactive react and next tutorial
React and next.js are some of the most needed skills of web developers. You can learn them by reading documentation or watching 
videos, but I believe that writing code by yourself is the best way to learn, pretty much anything. This included React and 
Next.js. Every time you learn a new concept, you can code in our interactive sandbox.

Ironically, this app is made with Sveltekit. Unless you have the intention of getting a job, I would recommend Svelte and Sveltekit.
